# Rust-Binary-Search-Implementation
This repository contains a safe and efficient implementation of binary search in Rust. The function bin_search searches for a target element in a sorted array of integers and returns both the value and its index if found. It is designed with safety in mind, handling edge cases like empty arrays and preventing integer underflow.
